## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES (Non-blocking)

1. **TypeScript Type Safety Warnings**: Using `as any` casts for populated Mongoose documents

   - Impact: None - functionality works correctly
   - Reason: TypeScript doesn't infer types for populated refs
   - Fix: Optional - create proper interfaces for populated documents

2. **Existing Service Method Compatibility**: Old `rescheduleAppointment()` and `cancelAppointment()` methods still exist
   - Impact: None - new methods are separate
   - Recommendation: Frontend should use new methods (`rescheduleAppointmentWithBilling`, `cancelAppointmentWithBilling`)

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (Priority Order)

### Phase 3: API Endpoints (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. Update AppointmentsController with new endpoints:

   - `PATCH /appointments/:id/reschedule-with-billing`
   - `DELETE /appointments/:id/cancel-with-billing`
   - `POST /appointments/:id/create-follow-up-suggestion`

2. Add DTO validation:
   - `RescheduleWithBillingDto`
   - `CancelWithBillingDto`
   - `CreateFollowUpDto`

### Phase 4: Frontend Components (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Patient Components**:

   - RescheduleModal with <30min warning
   - CancelModal with <30min warning
   - Follow-up Tab in my-appointments page
   - Vouchers list page

2. **Doctor Components**:
   - Follow-up suggestion button in appointment detail
   - DoctorCancelModal with reason select (emergency/patient_late)
   - Enhanced schedule view with follow-up indicators

### Phase 5: Email Notifications (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- Create email templates for:
  - Appointment rescheduled (with/without fee)
  - Appointment cancelled (patient initiated, with/without fee)
  - Appointment cancelled (doctor emergency, with voucher)
  - Appointment cancelled (doctor - patient late)
  - Follow-up suggestion (with voucher code)
  - Voucher expiration reminder

### Phase 6: Testing (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

- Unit tests for BillingHelperService
- Unit tests for VouchersService
- Integration tests for appointment flows
- E2E tests for complete user journeys

## 📝 USAGE EXAMPLES

### Reschedule with Billing

```typescript
const result = await appointmentsService.rescheduleAppointmentWithBilling(
  appointmentId,
  {
    appointmentDate: new Date("2024-01-20"),
    startTime: "10:00",
    duration: 30,
  },
  userId
);
// result: { newAppointment, feeCharged: true/false, feeAmount: 100000 or 0 }
```

### Cancel with Billing

```typescript
const result = await appointmentsService.cancelAppointmentWithBilling(
  appointmentId,
  "Không thể đến được",
  "patient" // or 'doctor'
  // doctorReason: 'emergency' or 'patient_late' (if cancelledBy === 'doctor')
);
// result: { appointment, feeCharged, feeAmount, refundIssued, voucherCreated }
```

### Create Follow-up Suggestion

```typescript
const result = await appointmentsService.createFollowUpSuggestion(
  parentAppointmentId,
  new Date("2024-02-01"),
  "14:00",
  "Tái khám kiểm tra sau điều trị"
);
// result: { followUpAppointment, voucher }
```

### Apply Voucher

```typescript
const result = await vouchersService.applyVoucher(
  "DENTAL123456",
  patientId,
  200000 // original amount
);
// result: { discountedAmount: 190000, voucherId: '...' }
```
